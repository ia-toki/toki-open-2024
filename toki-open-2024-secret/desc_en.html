<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  There is a secret organisation with $N$ members, numbered from $0$ to $N - 1$.
  There are $M$ villages, numbered from $0$ to $M - 1$, where those members live.
  Member $i$ ($0 \le i \le N - 1$) lives in village $A[i]$.
</p><p>
  The villages are connected in a circular way by $M$ bidirectional roads, numbered from $0$ to $M - 1$.
  Road $j$ connects villages $j$ and $j + 1$ (for each $0 \le j \le M - 2$) and road $M - 1$ connects villages $0$ and village $M - 1$.
  The lengths of all roads are the same, so each road can be traversed in $1$ unit of time.
</p><p>
  Inside the organisation, member $S$ can issue a secret order to member $T$ ($S < T$).
  The order should be relayed from member $S$ to $S + 1$, then from member $S+1$ to $S+2$, and so on, until it finally reaches member $T$.
</p><p>
  The police department sometimes makes strict surveillance on some roads preventing any suspicious activities.
  Roads under strict surveillance cannot be used by secret organisation members to deliver orders.
  Initially, all roads are <strong>not</strong> under strict surveillance.
</p><p>
  There are $Q$ events, each is one of the following two types.
</p><ul>
  <li><code>toggle(R)</code>: the police department changes the surveillance status of road $R$, i.e. it will be under strict surveillance if it is currently not under strict surveillance, and vice versa.</li>
  <li><code>query(S, T)</code>: find the minimum time to relay the secret order issued by member $S$ to member $T$ without using roads under strict surveillance, or report if achieving such a thing is impossible.
</ul><p>
  You have to answer all the queries.
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li> $2 \le N \le 100\,000$</li>
  <li> $3 \le M \le 10^9$</li>
  <li> $0 \le A[i] \le M - 1$ (for each $0 \le i \le N - 1$) </li>
  <li> $1 \le Q \le 100\,000$</li>
  <li> $0 \le S < T \le N - 1$</li>
  <li> $0 \le R \le M - 1$</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>
  <li> (7 points) The <code>toggle</code> event will never happen.</li>
  <li> (9 points) $N \le 2000$; $Q \le 2000$</li>
  <li> (15 points) $A[i] < A[i + 1]$ (for each $0 \le i \le N - 2$)</li>
  <li> (20 points) Road $M - 1$ will always be under surveillance each time a <code>query</code> event happens. </li>
  <li> (20 points) $S = 0$; $T = N - 1$ </li>
  <li> (29 points) No additional constraints. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

You should implement the following procedure.

<pre>
void init(int N, int M, std::vector&lt;int&gt; A)
</pre>

<ul>
  <li> $N$: the number of members. </li>
  <li> $M$: the number of villages. </li>
  <li> $A$: an array of length $N$ describing where the members live. </li>
  <li> This procedure is called exactly once for each test case, before any calls to <code>toggle</code> and <code>query</code>. </li>
</ul>

<pre>
void toggle(int R)
</pre>

<ul>
  <li> $R$: the road that has its surveillance status changed. </li>
  <li> This procedure is called less than $Q$ times. </li>
</ul>

<pre>
long long query(int S, int T)
</pre>

<ul>
  <li> $S$, $T$: the members issuing and receiving the order. </li>
  <li> This procedure should return the minimum time to relay the order. If it is impossible, then this procedure should return $-1$.
  <li> This procedure and <code>toggle</code> procedure are called exactly $Q$ times in total.
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Consider the following call.</p>

<pre>
init(4, 5, [1, 1, 4, 2])
</pre>

<p>
  Next, the grader calls <code>toggle(4)</code>.
  Road $4$ connecting village $0$ and village $4$ is now under surveillance.
</p><p>
  Suppose the grader then calls <code>query(1, 2)</code>.
  Member $1$ relays order to member $2$ through roads $1$, $2$, $3$ in $3$ units of time.
  Therefore, you should return $3$.
</p><p>
  Next, the grader calls <code>toggle(1)</code>.
  Road $1$ connecting village $1$ and village $2$ is now under surveillance.
</p><p>
  Suppose the grader then calls <code>query(1, 2)</code>.
  There is no way for member $1$ to relay the order to member $2$.
  Therefore, the procedure should return $-1$.
</p><p>
  Suppose the grader then calls <code>query(0, 1)</code>.
  Because member $0$ and member $1$ live in the same village, no roads are used.
  Therefore, the procedure should return $0$.
</p><p>
  Next, the grader calls <code>toggle(1)</code> and then <code>toggle(4)</code>.
  Road $1$ and road $4$ are now no longer under surveillance.
</p><p>
  Suppose the grader then calls <code>query(0, 3)</code>.
  It can be shown that the order can be relayed to member $1$, $2$, then $3$ with $0$, $2$, and $2$ units of time respectively with a total time of $4$ units of time.
  Therefore, you should return $4$.
</p>

<h3>Sample Grader</h3>

<p>
  The sample grader reads the input in the following format:
</p><ul>
  <li> line $1$: $N \;\; M \;\; Q$ </li>
  <li> line $2$: $A[0] \;\; A[1] \;\; \ldots \;\; A[N - 1]$ </li>
  <li> line $3 + j$ ($0 \le j \le Q - 1$):
    <ul>
      <li>$0 \;\; R$ if the $j$-th event is <code>toggle(R)</code></li>
      <li>$1 \;\; S \;\; T$ if the $j$-th event is <code>query(S, T)</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The sample grader prints your answer in the following format:
</p><ul>
  <li> line $j$ ($j \ge 1$): the return value of $j$-th call to <code>query</code>. </li>
</ul>
