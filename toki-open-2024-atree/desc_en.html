<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  There is a tree-shaped copper mine with $N$ rooms, numbered from $0$ to $N - 1$, and $N - 1$ railways, numbered from $0$ to $N - 2$.
  Railway $i$ ($0 \le i \le N - 2$) connects rooms $U[i]$ and $V[i]$.
</p><p>
  You are operating a minecart that navigates between the rooms using the railways.
  The minecart is operated using $M$ buttons, numbered from $0$ to $M - 1$ from left to right.
  Button $j$ ($0 \le j \le M - 1$) will take the minecart to room $A[j]$.
  When a minecart is in room $u$, you can press a button that takes you to room $v$ if and only if $u$ and $v$ are connected by a railway.
  The minecart can explore all the rooms, i.e., for any room $i$ ($0 \le i \le N - 1$), there exists a button (possibly more than one) that takes you to room $i$.
</p><p>
  As an operator of the minecart, there is a safety protocol that you have to follow.
  You have to operate the minecart using only one hand, holding one button at all times.
  Whenever you decide to move, you will choose a button that you can press, press it, and then your hand will stay holding on to the pressed button.
  A <em>risky move</em> is when you move your hand to the left, or more formally: suppose your hand is on button $a$ and you decided to press button $b$, then the move is risky if and only if $b &lt; a$.
  The <em>total risk</em> is the number of risky moves that you make throughout the whole navigation.
  Initially, the minecart is located in room $0$ and your hand is holding button $0$.
  You are guaranteed that $A[0] = 0$.
</p><p>
  There is a sequence of rooms $S$ of length $L$ that you have to visit <strong>in that order</strong>.
  In other words, you must first visit room $S[0]$, then room $S[1]$, then room $S[2]$, and so on, and finally room $S[L - 1]$.
  You are also guaranteed that $S[k] \neq S[k + 1]$, for all $0 \le k \le L - 2$.
</p><p>
  You have to find the minimum total risk after you have visited the sequence of rooms $S$.

  <li> $S[k] \neq S[k + 1]$ (for each $0 \le k \le L - 2$)</li>
  <li> The railways form a tree. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>
  <li> (9 points) $M = N$; $U[i] = i$; $V[i] = i + 1$ (for each $0 \le i \le N - 2$)</li>
  <li> (18 points) $M = N$</li>
  <li> (16 points) $N, M, L \le 4000$</li>
  <li> (31 points) $U[i] = i$; $V[i] = i + 1$ (for each $0 \le i \le N - 2$)</li>
  <li> (26 points) No additional constraints.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

You should implement the following procedure.

<pre>
long long min_risk(int N, int M, int L, std::vector&lt;int&gt; U, std::vector&lt;int&gt; V, std::vector&lt;int&gt; A, std::vector&lt;int&gt; S)
</pre>

<ul>
  <li> $N$: the number of rooms in the copper mine. </li>
  <li> $M$: the number of buttons. </li>
  <li> $L$: the length of the sequence of rooms to visit. </li>
  <li> $U$, $V$: arrays of length $N - 1$ describing the railways. </li>
  <li> $A$: array of length $M$ describing the buttons. </li>
  <li> $S$: array of length $L$ describing the sequence of rooms to visit. </li>
  <li> This procedure should return the minimum total risk. </li>
  <li> This procedure is called exactly once for each test case. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Consider the following call.</p>

<pre>
min_risk(4, 6, 3, [1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 3], [0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1], [0, 2, 3])
</pre>

<p>
  The copper mine can be illustrated as follows.
</p><p align="center">
  <img src="render/sample.png" style="width: 250px" />
</p><p>
  You can move the minecart as follows.
</p><ol>
  <li>Initially, you are holding button $0$ and in room $0$, hence room $S[0]$ is visited. </li>
  <li>Press button $5$ and move to room $1$.</li>
  <li>Press button $2$ and move to room $2$; you visited room $S[1]$; this is a risky move.</li>
  <li>Press button $3$ and move to room $1$.</li>
  <li>Press button $4$ and move to room $3$; you visited room $S[2]$.</li>
</ol><p>
  You visited the sequence of rooms with a total risk of $1$.
  There are no ways to visit the sequence of rooms with fewer risky moves.
  Therefore, the procedure should return $1$.
</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Consider the following call.</p>

<pre>
min_risk(5, 9, 2, [0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 0], [4, 2])
</pre>

<p>
  Initially, you are holding button $0$, then you press the buttons $5$, $1$, $4$, $2$, $4$, $7$, in that order.
  The total risk is $2$ and there are no ways to achieve fewer risky moves.
  Therefore, the procedure should return $2$.
</p>

<h3>Sample Grader</h3>

<p>
  The sample grader reads the input in the following format:
</p><ul>
  <li> line $1$: $N \;\; M \;\; L$ </li>
  <li> line $2 + i$ ($0 \le i \le N - 2$): $U[i] \;\; V[i]$ </li>
  <li> line $N + 1$: $A[0] \;\; A[1] \;\; \ldots \;\; A[M - 1]$ </li>
  <li> line $N + 2$: $S[0] \;\; S[1] \;\; \ldots \;\; S[L - 1]$ </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The sample grader prints your answer in the following format:
</p><ul>
  <li> line $1$: the return value of <code>min_risk</code>. </li>
</ul>
