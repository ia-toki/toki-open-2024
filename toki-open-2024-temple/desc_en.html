<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  There is a stone temple consisting of $N$ rooms, numbered from $0$ to $N - 1$, and $M$ corridors, numbered from $0$ to $M - 1$.
  Using corridor $i$ ($0 \le i \le M - 1$), you can walk from room $U[i]$ to room $V[i]$, and vice versa.
  It is known that the temple is connected, in which you can walk from a room to any other room using one or more corridors.
  The entrance is located in room $0$, and there are $K$ exits located in different rooms $P[0], P[1], \ldots, P[K - 1]$.
  There is at least one exit and no exit in room $0$.
</p><p>
  There is a stone merchant in each corridor.
  Whenever you walk through corridor $i$ ($0 \le i \le M - 1$), the stone merchant will give you a stone with weight $W[i]$, whether you like it or not.
  The merchant will still give you a stone even when you have walked through the corridor before.
</p><p>
  Every time you receive a stone, you will put it into your bag.
  Each time you put a new stone into your bag, every <strong>other stone</strong> with weight <strong>smaller than or equal to</strong> the new stone will vanish.
  The new stone you just received will not vanish when you put it into your bag.
</p><p>
  You entered the temple through the entrance, and want to exit through any exit.
  You do not have to exit immediately when you find an exit.
  You are free to walk through any room or corridor any number of times.
  What is the minimum possible sum of weights of the stones inside your bag after you exit?
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li> $2 \le N \le 100\,000$</li>
  <li> $N - 1 \le M \le \min\left(200\,000, \frac{N \cdot (N - 1)}{2}\right)$</li>
  <li> $1 \le K \le N - 1$</li>
  <li> $0 \le U[i] &lt; V[i] \le N - 1$ (for each $0 \le i \le M - 1$)</li>
  <li> $1 \le W[i] \le 10^9$ (for each $0 \le i \le M - 1$)</li>
  <li> $1 \le P[i] \le N - 1$ (for each $0 \le i \le K - 1$)</li>
  <li> $(U[i], V[i]) \neq (U[j], V[j])$ (for each $0 \le i &lt; j \le M - 1$)</li>
  <li> $P[i] \neq P[j]$ (for each $0 \le i &lt; j \le K - 1$)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>

  <li> (6 points) $N \le 1000$; $M = N - 1$; $U[i] = i$; $V[i] = i + 1$ (for each $0 \le i \le N - 2$); $K = 1$; $P[0] = N - 1$ </li>
  <li> (10 points) $N \le 1000$; $M \le 2000$; there are at most $2$ different values in $W$.</li>
  <li> (14 points) $N \le 1000$; $M \le 2000$; there are at most $10$ different values in $W$.</li>
  <li> (27 points) $N \le 1000$; $M \le 2000$ </li>
  <li> (29 points) $K = 1$; $P[0] = N - 1$ </li>
  <li> (14 points) No additional constraints. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

You should implement the following procedure.

<pre>
long long min_weight(int N, int M, int K, std::vector&lt;int&gt; U, std::vector&lt;int&gt; V, std::vector&lt;int&gt; W, std::vector&lt;int&gt; P)
</pre>

<ul>
  <li> $N$: the number of rooms. </li>
  <li> $M$: the number of corridors. </li>
  <li> $K$: the number of exits. </li>
  <li> $U$, $V$: arrays of length $M$ describing the corridors. </li>
  <li> $W$: an array of length $M$ describing the weights of the given stones. </li>
  <li> $P$: an array of length $K$ describing the exits. </li>
  <li> This procedure should return the minimum weight of stones after you exit. </li>
  <li> This procedure is called exactly once for each test case. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Consider the following call.</p>

<pre>
min_weight(7, 8, 2, [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 6], [6, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 2], [5, 6])
</pre>

<p>
  The stone temple can be illustrated as follows.
</p><p align="center">
  <img src="render/sample.png" style="width: 300px" />
</p><p>
  One of your strategies to walk through the temple is as follows.
</p><ol>
  <li>Start from the entrance in room $0$. The bag is initially empty.</li>
  <li>Walk through corridor $5$ and into room $4$. The bag now contains weights $\{4\}$.</li>
  <li>Walk through corridor $4$ and into room $3$. The bag now contains weights $\{3, 4\}$.</li>
  <li>Walk through corridor $6$ and into room $1$. The bag now contains weights $\{5\}$.</li>
  <li>Walk through corridor $1$ and into room $2$. The bag now contains weights $\{1, 5\}$.</li>
  <li>Walk through corridor $2$ and into room $5$. The bag now contains weights $\{1, 5\}$.</li>
  <li>Exit the temple with final bag weight $1 + 5 = 6$.</li>
</ol><p>
  There are no other ways to exit the temple with less bag weight.
  Therefore, the procedure should return $6$.
</p>

<h3>Sample Grader</h3>

<p>
  The sample grader reads the input in the following format:
</p><ul>
  <li> line $1$: $N \;\; M \;\; K$ </li>
  <li> line $2 + i$ ($0 \le i \le M - 1$): $U[i] \;\; V[i] \;\; W[i]$ </li>
  <li> line $M + 2$: $P[0] \;\; P[1] \;\; \ldots \;\; P[K - 1]$ </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The sample grader prints your answer in the following format:
</p><ul>
  <li> line $1$: the return value of <code>min_weights</code>. </li>
</ul>
